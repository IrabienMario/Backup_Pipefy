# Backup_Pipefy
## Introduction:
Pipefy is a Kanban model system designed to help companies with their different tasks and proccesses. This way, the administrators of the company can monitor all the work done within the organization. They can approve or deny activities and control the workflow effectively.
  This is a great system for small or medium-sized companies. However, it has several issues that can be problematic for the maintenance and growth of the company and its data. For instance, the accessibility of the data that users have on their Pipes is limited. You can view and create some restricted reports, but its not as flexible as a database.
  For this app, we aim to solve one of its biggest problems: data backups. Its well known that in any company with critical data, making backups is alomst mandatory. Although Pipefy provides a way to generate general reports or reports on specific Pipes, the data in these reports is close to the original but creating them manually is too slow.

## Problematic:
The Pipefy platform does not provide an accessible tool for making data backups.

## Objective:
Creat an accesible app that can provide data backups with the completed data.
